# Short-term Hands-on Supplementary Course on C programming 2022

This repository contains the material used in the `Short-term Hands-on Supplementary Course in C Programming` for building C programming skills amongst the B.E. Computer Science & Engineering undergraduates in the [Computer Science & Engineering Department](https://www.ssn.edu.in/college-of-engineering/computer-science-and-engineering-department-ssn-institutions/) at [Sri Sivasubramaniya Nadar College of Engineering](https://www.ssn.edu.in/) through a practicum-driven lesson plan during Nov-Dec 2022.

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Session 1 - 21.11.2022         
Problems to solve

1) Develop a simple calculator using conditional statements of C
2) Using loops implement C code to <br />
      a) find factorial of a number <br />
      b) find sum of first 'n' even integers <br />
      
---------------------------------------------------------------
## Session 2 - 22.11.2022 
Problems to solve

1) print only odd numbers in a given range of 'n', using continue.
2) print the pattern
        5
      45
    345
  2345
12345
3) Print prime number in a given range. NOTE- prime numbers are only divisible by 1 and the same number.
4) write a program to display multiplication table from 1 to 10.

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Session 3 - 23.11.2022 
Problems to solve

1) Perform Matrix Multiplication in C.
2) Given a matrix print the transpose of the matrix.
3) Insert an element in the beginning, end and in between 2 elements in the given array.
4) Delete an element in an array.

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Session 4 - 24.11.2022 
Problems to solve

1) Write a menu driven C program to do all the operations in an array along with selection and insertion sort.

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Session 5 - 25.11.2022
Problems to solve

1) Find the length of given string without using in built function.
2) Implement string concatenate of 2 strings without using in built function.
3) Implement string reversal without using in built function.
4) Check whether the given string is a palindrome or not without using built in function.

Additional questions
1) Implement string comparision without using built-in function.
2) Case conversion without using in built function.
3) Implement string reversal but by reducing the no. of iteration by half(to increase the efficiency of your code).

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Session 6 - 26.11.2022
Problems to solve

1) Write a C function to implement calculator and ask user for the operation.
2) Write a function for selection sort. (Array must be a paramter to the function. Array should be an user input in main.)

Try this

Rewrite the array operations code implemented before (session 3) using functions. Note: The size of the array has to be a parameter to the function which has to be altered after every operation.

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Session 7 - 28.11.2022
Problems to solve

1) Write a recursive C function to find the sum of digits of a number.
2) Implement binary search using simple loops in C.
3) Write a recursive C function to implement binary search on a array.
4) Write a recursive C program to find a binary representation of a given decimal number.
5) Write a recursive C program to find the LCM and GCD of two numbers.

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Session 8 - 29.11.2022
Problems to solve

1) Write a program in C to print all permutations of a given string using pointers.
2) Write a program in C to find the largest element using Dynamic Memory Allocation.
3) Write a program in C to Calculate the length of the string using a pointer.

Additional Problem
1) Implement singly linked list using pointers in C as 3 different files ( namely adt.h, impl.h, appl.c ).

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Session 10 - 06.12.2022
Problems to solve

1) Create a datatype ‘fraction’ with numerator and denominator. Perform fraction addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
Note: Find LCM for addition and subtraction problem. Make it a menu drive program.  
2) Create a datatype ‘Student’ with name, roll number, marks for 5 subjects as an array. Maintain an array of student type and sort them based on their total marks in descending order.

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Session 11 - 07.12.2022
Problems to solve

1) Try file operations in different modes.
2) Examination Problems to be revisited and tried.

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Session 12 - 08.12.2022
Problems to solve

1) Implement singly linked list in C using structures and pointers with the following functionalities
      a.	Insert front
      b.	Insert end
      c.	Insert in middle
      d.	Delete a node
      e.	Display the list
